### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luigi, a 27 years old software engineer based in Naples ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸŒŠ with 5+ years of experience specialized in Web development. I'm currently working at Automattic.

I love Open Source and community events where I have participated as an attendee as well as a speaker (Linux Day, Merge-it)

I'm a self-taught and I strongly believe in the spirit of knowledge sharing, so I decided to start free [mentoring](https://calendly.com/gigitux/45min?month=2021-03)

> If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.
